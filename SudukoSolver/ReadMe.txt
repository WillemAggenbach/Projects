I have two main Classes. One which takes in Command line arguements and one for the GUI.They are called SudukoCmd and SudukoGui respectively.

SudukoGui:
This Program will run without command line arguements. There must be a Textfile Named "In.ins" in the main SudukoSolver folder(/workspace/SudukoSolver). There is one provided to show. The Program will read this text for the Board which will be shown in on the Gui. A command file is also required in the same location as the board file. It must be named "c.cf". One is also provided to show. This will contain the spesific command to be run on the board. After the program is launched and the Gui shows up then the Command would have already been followed through. Clicking on the spesific cell where things have been updated will show the Current possibilities for that cell and Which rules were applied on which numbers. Notice the Rule Buttons. You can spesify a spesific rule by putting in the row, column(both values from 0-8) and number for which the rule should be run with. If you need a new with new Values for this, you can Copy over the case onto the textfield on the top and press the "Add Board" Button to change the Board with a fresh start. You can use any of the rule Buttons then with this new board and it will update. Running Any of Rule 4 will Let the Graphs be displayed.

SudukoCmd:
All of the necessesary files to compile are within the src Folder. 
Simply:"/SudukoSolver/src$ javac *.java"

Compile and run through the Command Line with the name SudukoCmd. It takes the first arguement as the name of the Textfile with the Board in it(Example: c_1.ins). The second arguement takes the name of the Textfile with the Command on it to be run. Both of these arguements follow a set path to the Text File spesified Within the SudukoSolvers/src folder("SudukoSolver/src").This can be changed in the code if neccesary By changing the ReadCommand() and ReadBoard() Methods.Meaning for them. It will print out the Changes if any through System.out.print. And a TextFile will be Created Which will be the name of the Command File only with .outs containing the Output Entries. Each one a new line. This TextFile will appear within the SudukoSolver Default folder.
